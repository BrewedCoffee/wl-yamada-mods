This is a Terrain/ Navy mod. This mod only works with select maps. (more to be added later)
This is how Map select works :
by choosing the Map Value you decide which map is used

1 - IS: Europe World War Supergame
2 - Baconsizzle's Big World

it only works in select ways (perhaps more to be added later)

This is how Mod select works :
by choosing your mod value, you decide which special units are immune from the affects of this mod.

0 - All special units including commanders
1 - I.S. Character Pack ( Antiquity ) special units
2 - I.S. Character Pack ( Ship Props ) special units

What is actually happening
the mod loops through each territory with certain names and turns them into neutrals, then sets there
army value to your neutral value (The third option)

if however you have a speical unit from your choosen mod, you now effectively have Navel warfare.

First turn takes longer then the rest
