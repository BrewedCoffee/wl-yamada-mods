Is a helper mod for Immersive system style multi day days. but anyone can use it.

In short, makes sure only one city stack per bonus is allowed. would recommand with local deployment
but no required. if you dont use local deployment just know super bonuses always override regular bonuses
meaning, since you can only have 1 city per bonus, the super bonuse will delete everything in it except
1 city stack

city stack = a territroy with cities on it. usually more then one
